			<h3>History</h3>
			<p>The University of California, San Diego Dragon Boat Team was started in 2003 by a group of ambitious students looking to take their passion for the competitive sport they first encountered in high school to the college level. From its humble beginnings, the team has now grown into one of the top collegiate teams in California, competing in San Francisco's CDBA Collegiate Championship, Tempe's Arizona Dragon Boat Festival, the Long Beach Spring Race, the Long Beach Summer Dragon Boat Festival, and the San Francisco International Dragon Boat Festival.</p>

			<h3>What is dragon boat?</h3>
			<p>Dragon boat racing is an ancient canoeing sport originating from an annual ethnic ritual over the past two thousand years throughout southern China, that later spread throughout southeastern Asia and recently all over the globe. A dragon boat is essentially a 40 foot canoe that accommodates 20 paddlers (2 per row), a drummer and a steersman. Although competition has taken place for more than two millennia as part of religious ceremonies and folk customs, dragon boat racing has more recently risen as a competitive international sport.</p>
